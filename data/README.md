Data
====

You can obtain the datasets from the PhysioNet2020 webpage [https://physionetchallenges.org/2020/](https://physionetchallenges.org/2020/)

Alternatively you can use the script [download.sh](download.sh) to download them. Note that you may need to be logged into a Google account to access these files.

In the examples used in this repo we have downloaded all data into an Amazon S3 bucket which we will use throughout the scripts and examples.
